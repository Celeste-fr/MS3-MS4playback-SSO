# Playing through Ableton Live 12

Branch `live-integration` (2026-09-28, 2026-09-29). The owner's goal: MuseScore still plays by itself
exactly as before (Spitfire Symphony Orchestra hosted in Kontakt Player 8). Optionally it plays
through Ableton Live 12 instead. In that mode Live hosts SSO and all automation is drawn in Live. The
automation is then read back into the score, so MuseScore alone plays it the same way. In
MuseScore it is read-only: it is edited only in Live.

There are two ways to play through Live:

1. **MuseScore plays through Live** (*Mixer › Play through Live*, 2026-09-28). MuseScore is the
   clock: it sends each part's notes, switches and controllers live to Live, plus MIDI clock and
   Song Position Pointer. Live has no notes of its own; its arrangement is in the score's
   quarter notes. Sections 1-5 below.
2. **Live plays the score** (*Mixer › Advanced Options… › Ableton Live › Live plays the score*,
   2026-09-29; the owner: "is it possible to have entered notes in the score live update in
   ableton?", then "what if it's the other way, when ableton is playing sound MuseScore switches
   off"). Each part's notes are a clip in Live's arrangement, kept up to date with every edit of
   the score. Live is the clock and plays; MuseScore sends the library nothing and follows Live.
   Section [Live plays the score](#live-plays-the-score).

How the first fits together:

- **Notes**: MuseScore sends each sound-library part to MIDI output A-D. Each part gets its own
  route (port and channel), the same one *View › Sound Library…* shows.
- **Sync**: MuseScore sends MIDI clock (24 per quarter note), Song Position Pointer and
  Start/Continue/Stop to a separate *MIDI sync output* (`libmscore/midisync.h`, `Seq::process`).
  Live follows tempo and position, jumps included.
- **Automation**: Live saves the automation in its set (.als). *Mixer › Advanced Options… ›
  Import automation from Live Set…* reads it into the score as read-only lanes
  (`libmscore/liveset.h`, `libmscore/automation.h`, `mscore/liveintegration.h`).
- **Switching**: *Mixer › Play through Live* switches between Live and the plug-in hosted by
  MuseScore.

## Set up on Windows

### 1. Virtual MIDI ports (loopMIDI)

Install loopMIDI (Tobias Erichsen) and create these ports:

- `MuseScore A`, plus `MuseScore B`, `MuseScore C` and `MuseScore D` as needed. Each port
  carries 16 parts, in score order.
- `MuseScore Sync`, for the clock only. Live turns Sync on per input port, and a port that also
  carries notes would need both settings on the same input.

### 2. MuseScore

**Preferences › I/O:**
- PortAudio: on.
- MIDI output: `MuseScore A`.
- Output latency: **20 ms** is a good start. At 0, PortMidi ignores the timestamps and sends each
  message when the audio block is computed, so clock and notes jitter by up to one audio
  buffer. With a latency, every message leaves at its exact time. Tested here: clocks within
  about 1 ms, and each beat's note within 1 ms of its clock.

**Preferences › I/O › Sound library:**
- Library: Spitfire Symphony Orchestra.
- Play through: MIDI output, or use the Mixer switch (see below).
- MIDI output B, C, D: `MuseScore B` … if the score has more than 16 library parts.
- MIDI sync output: `MuseScore Sync`.

**Mixer:**
- Playback, all parts: *Sound library*.
- *Play through Live*: on. It asks first, because the patches loaded in MuseScore are released
  (their memory freed). Switching back loads them again.

*View › Sound Library…* lists each part's port and channel, plus the patch Live must load for it.

### 3. Live 12

**Settings › Link, Tempo & MIDI:**
- `MuseScore Sync` input: **Sync** on. Sync Type: MIDI Clock. Track and Remote off.
- `MuseScore A`-`D` inputs: **Track** on. Sync off.
- Link: off. Live cannot receive MIDI clock while Link is on (Live 12.1 manual, 34.3.2).
- Select `MuseScore Sync` in the MIDI Ports list to see its **Sync Delay**. Adjust it until
  Live's sound lines up with MuseScore's click (manual 34.3.3).

**Control bar:**
- Turn on **EXT** (or *Options › External Sync*). The upper LED next to it flashes when Live
  receives the clock.
- Keep Live's **Loop switch off**. With the loop on, Live wraps song positions into the loop
  (manual 34.3.2), so MuseScore's positions would land in the wrong place.

**One MIDI track per part:**
- Kontakt 8 with the patch *View › Sound Library…* names for that part.
- **Articulation switching "UACC & UI only"** in each patch. This is what MuseScore's own setups
  use (`$iooxo` = 3). MuseScore switches articulations with UACC on CC32.
- *MIDI From*: `MuseScore A` (or B-D) and the part's channel (`Ch. n`).
- *Monitor*: **In**.

**Arrangement:**
- Work in the Arrangement view. Beat 1.1.1 is the score's start.
- MuseScore sets the tempo; Live follows it. Live's own tempo and time signature don't matter,
  but the arrangement is in played time: repeats are written out.

### 4. Drawing automation in Live

- Kontakt shows each SSO patch's named controls as automation slots: Dynamics, Vibrato,
  Expression, Release, Tightness, Mic 1-5, Mic Mix Distance, Variation, Reverb …
- For a Kontakt device, click *Configure* in its header, then click (or move) the control in
  Kontakt's window. It is added to Live's panel under Kontakt's name for it (manual 23.3.1.2).
- Draw its automation in the arrangement.
- MuseScore matches it by that name to the map's controller of the part (`param` title). Matching
  is loose, like `Vst3Plugin::parameterId`: case, punctuation and a slot number in front such as
  "#002" are ignored.
- **Leave Dynamics and Expression to MuseScore.** It sends CC1 and CC11 from the notation;
  automation of Kontakt's Dynamics slot would fight with them.
- A MIDI clip's CC envelopes are imported too. A CC goes to the map's controller on that CC, or
  else becomes a raw `cc<n>` lane.
- Automation in a repeat's second pass is left out, because a lane follows the score, not the
  repeats. The import report counts those points.

### 5. Saving, and bringing the automation back

- Save the set (Ctrl+S).
- In MuseScore: *Mixer › Advanced Options… › Ableton Live (this score) › Import automation from
  Live Set…*. Choose the `.als`. A report lists which track went to which part, and what was
  not imported (tracks without a part, parameters without a controller, Live's mixer).
- *Import again when Live saves it* (on by default): each save in Live re-imports the set. The
  re-import waits until playback stops.
- Every import is one undoable step. *Unlink* removes the link and the Live lanes.
- How a track finds its part:
  1. By its MIDI input: the port and channel of the part's route. The port names are MuseScore's
     MIDI outputs without the driver's prefix (`MMSystem,MuseScore A` → `MuseScore A`).
  2. Otherwise by track name = part name.
- The lanes are stored in the score's metaTag `automation`, each marked `"source": "live"` with
  the set's path and time, the track and Live's parameter name and id. The metaTag `liveSet`
  holds the link. MuseScore 3.6 keeps both through a round trip (tested with 3.6.2).
- With *Play through Live* on, MuseScore sends nothing for these lanes, since Live plays them
  itself. It also sends no value of its own for those controllers.
- With *Play through Live* off, MuseScore's hosted Kontakt plays them as plug-in parameter
  events, the same way as in Live.

## What still needs the owner's Live set

The .als reader follows the element names that open-source readers use: DawVert, dawtool, and
abletoolz's Live 12 fixtures. The test sets were written by hand
(`mtest/libmscore/liveintegration/liveset.xml`). Not yet checked against a real set:

- **A track's MIDI input for one port and channel.** Only Live's default is documented
  (`MidiIn/External.All/-1`, "Ext: All Ins"). The reader tries the display strings first
  ("MuseScore A" / "Ext: MuseScore A", "Ch. 3"), then the target's string. The name match is
  the fallback.
- **Curved automation** (`CurveControl1X/1Y/2X/2Y`). No open-source reader evaluates it. It is
  read as a cubic Bézier in the segment's box (a guess) and turned into 16 straight pieces.
- Whether Live stores Kontakt's parameter values normalized 0-1, as the fixtures suggest.
- Whether `ParameterId` is Kontakt's VST 3 parameter id. It is kept in each lane as `paramId`,
  but not used yet.

The sample needed: a small Live 12 set, **saved with no samples collected** (the `.als` alone),
containing:

- one MIDI track with Kontakt 8 and one SSO patch, *MIDI From* `MuseScore A`, Ch. 2;
- two automated controls, for example Vibrato and Release, one of them with a curve (Alt-drag a
  segment);
- a MIDI clip with a CC envelope, for example CC 21;
- a second track left at "All Ins".

A screenshot of Live's automation lanes would make the check exact. As with every file the owner
sends, it stays out of the repository.

## Kontakt's state from the set (not done)

Each Kontakt device in the set carries Kontakt's own state (`Vst3Preset/ProcessorState`, hex). It is
the same kind of data as MuseScore's `.vst3state` setups: an NI container with a multi that
embeds the patch. It could be loaded into MuseScore's instance so that both hold identical
settings. This is not done, for three reasons:

- **Not needed for SSO's own controls.** SSO's patches name their automation slots in their
  script, so a patch loaded by MuseScore and the same patch loaded in Live have the same named
  slots (the extract of all 700 patches). Matching by name is enough.
- **It would replace MuseScore's made setups** (`KontaktSetup`, "made setups.json", the resave
  after the first load) with a state from outside. Kontakt refused made setups before (run 107)
  and loaded some slowly (run 112), so a foreign state needs its own tries.
- **It would carry Live-side choices into MuseScore:** UACC off if it wasn't set in Live, Live's
  other tweaks, sample paths.

It becomes worth doing if the owner assigns Kontakt host-automation slots to controls SSO doesn't
name. Those assignments live only in Kontakt's state. For that case each lane already keeps
Live's `paramId`.

## Fallback: Tracktion Waveform

From the research of 2026-09-28 (tracktion_engine's source, Tracktion's developer on the JUCE
forum):

- **Waveform cannot follow MIDI clock or Song Position Pointer.**
  - Tracktion's developer (JUCE forum, 2022-04-06): "we can send outgoing MIDI clock but not
    sync to incoming".
  - The engine reads MIDI Timecode (MTC, with drift correction) and MMC on its MIDI inputs, but
    has no incoming clock or SPP.
  - So as a follower it would need **MTC + MMC** from MuseScore instead of clock and SPP, and
    MuseScore doesn't send those yet. MTC is time-based, not beat-based, so a tempo map would
    not travel either: Waveform's edit would have to hold the same tempo map, or be kept in
    seconds.
- **The `.tracktionedit` format is XML**, the engine's ValueTree written out.
  - `EditFileOperations::writeToFile` writes `edit.state.createXml()`. Temporary saves may use
    JUCE's binary ValueTree format, and `loadEditFromFile` reads both.
  - Plug-in automation is an `AUTOMATIONCURVE` element (`paramID`) with `POINT t= v= c=`
    children. `c` = 0 is linear; −0.5 … 0.5 is a Bézier (`getBezierPoint`).
  - Times are in **seconds** for plug-in parameter curves (`TimeBase::time`).
  - The format is not documented as such, but tracktion_engine's source defines it
    (`tracktion_AutomationCurve.cpp`, `tracktion_Identifiers.h`). A reader like `LiveSet` would
    be about as much work, plus seconds → ticks through the score's tempo map.
- **Embedding tracktion_engine instead:**
  - Licence: GPLv3-or-later or commercial.
  - It is a JUCE module (JUCE as a git submodule, C++20) and hosts VST 3 through JUCE.
  - It would bring a second plug-in host and audio engine into MuseScore, next to the VST 3
    hosting this fork already has (`audio/vst3`), mainly for automation editing that MuseScore
    could draw itself.
  - The repository is about 1.6 GB with its history.
  - MuseScore 3's build (Qt 5, C++17 in places) would need C++20 for that module.

In short: as a DAW beside MuseScore, Waveform needs MTC/MMC output from MuseScore. As a library,
tracktion_engine is a large dependency for what the existing hosting plus a lane editor would
do.
